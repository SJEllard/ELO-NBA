                    NBA Elo System is an inferential rating system that calculates the 
                    relative strength of NBA teams. Elo rating systems were 
                    originally used as an improved chess rating system. Since then, they have also
                    been used in baseball, basketball, and competitive video games such as 
                    World of Warcraft. 
                    <br><br>
                    A teams strength is represented by their rating (the higher, the better). 
                    After every game, the winner takes points from the loser. 
                    The amount of points won (or lost) is determined by the difference in ratings. 
                    For example, when a high rated team beats a low rated team they will only win a few points.
                    But, when a low rated team upsets a high rated team, they win many points.  
                    <br><br>

                <h2>2018-19 NBA Elo Analysis</h2>     
                    <br>   
                <p> 
                    Before digging into the algorithm lets look at some of the results. 
                    Here we have a graph of all 30 NBA teams' Elo ratings after the 2018-19 regular season.
                </p>

                <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="/images/regseason_bar.PNG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="2018-19 NBA Regular Season">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><small>2018-19 Regular Season</small></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br>
                <p> 
                        According to the Elo Rating System the Houston Rockets had the best performance,
                        closely followed by the Portland Trail Blazers and the Milwaukee Bucks. 
                        <br><br>
                        Milwaukee should not be a surprise - MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo lead the Bucks to finish 1st overall in terms of
                        win-loss, finishing the regular season 60-22.
                        <br><br>
                        Conversely, our Elo Rating System values the Rockets and the Trail Blazers greater then a 
                        simple win-loss record might suggest, both those teams finished 53-29 (Tied for 5th overall).
                </p>
                <p> 
                    ...Let's look at the results including the playoffs...
                </p>
                <br>
                <figure class="figure">
                        <img src="/images/bothseason_bar.PNG" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="2018-19 Full Season (Regular Season and Playoffs)">
                        <figcaption class="figure-caption"><small>2018-19 Full Season (Regular Season and Playoffs)</small></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <br><br>
                <p> 
                        After the full season the Toronto Raptors 
                        were rated as having the best performance. They did win the 2019 NBA Championship, 
                        so this makes sense. 
                        <br><br>
                        An interesting aspect of this result is how large the Raptors' rating difference 
                        is from the regular season to the playoffs (1627 to 1743, a <b>116  point increase</b>). 
                        The Golden State Warriors and Philadephia 76ers also had signficant performance rating jumps,
                        69 and 44 points respectively.
