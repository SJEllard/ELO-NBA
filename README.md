# NBA Elo System
A NBA Elo Rating System 

<h2>Description</h2>
NBA Elo System is an inferential rating system that calculates the relative strength of NBA teams. 

A teams strength is represented by their rating (the higher, the better). 
After every game, the winner takes points from the loser. 

The amount of points won (or lost) is determined by the difference in ratings. 
For example, when a high rated team beats a low rated team they will only win a few points.
But, when a low rated team upsets a high rated team, they win many points.
